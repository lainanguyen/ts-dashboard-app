# ts-dashboard-app

<p>In this project, I will be creating a dashboard web application that showcases the statistics of messages, work orders and calls that the Help Desk in the Cairn University's Technology Services office gets. </p>

<p>This will help evaluate the changes needed to be taken to ensure the most efficient work depending on busiest traffic hours. </p>

<p>Languages used are Javascript, React, HTML, CSS. <p>
